## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Task**: Cross-Camera Player Re-Identification and Mapping

**Objective**: Given two video clips (`broadcast.mp4` and `tacticam.mp4`) capturing the same gameplay from different camera angles, establish consistent player identities across both feeds by mapping each player such that they retain the same `player_id` across both camera views.

### Challenge Overview

In modern sports analytics, multiple camera systems capture gameplay from different angles and perspectives. The challenge is to create a robust system that can:

- **Detect** all players, goalkeepers, referees, and other objects in both video feeds
- **Match** corresponding players between different camera viewpoints using consistent `player_id` values
- **Maintain** identity consistency across temporal sequences
- **Handle** varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and perspective differences

## 📋 Instructions

### Core Requirements
1. **Object Detection**: Use the provided object detection model to detect players in both videos
2. **Player Matching**: Match each player from the tacticam video to their corresponding identity in the broadcast video using consistent `player_id` values
3. **Feature Engineering**: Use any combination of visual, spatial, or temporal features to establish the mapping

The complete output video demonstrates our system's ability to maintain consistent player identities across both camera angles throughout the entire sequence, with color-coded bounding boxes indicating matched players.

> **Note**: Place your video files in the `videos/` directory. Supported formats: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`

## 🚀 Technical Approach

### System Architecture

Our solution implements a comprehensive **PlayerReIDPipeline** based on research in multi-view spatial localization and cross-camera view-overlap recognition:

#### 1. **Object Detection Module**
Model classes detected:
{0: 'ball', 1: 'goalkeeper', 2: 'player', 3: 'referee'}

- **Model**: YOLOv8-based detection system
- **Strategy**: Very low confidence threshold (0.1) for maximum recall
- **Output**: Bounding boxes, confidence scores, class labels

#### 2. **Feature Extraction System**
- **Visual Features**: 
  - RGB color histograms (8 bins per channel)
  - Spatial characteristics (aspect ratio, area)
- **Spatial Features**:
  - Normalized coordinates relative to frame dimensions
  - Bounding box geometry
- **Temporal Features**:
  - Cross-frame consistency
  - Movement patterns

#### 3. **Cross-Camera Matching Algorithm**
- **Similarity Computation**: Cosine similarity between feature vectors
- **Class-Aware Boosting**: 1.5x multiplier for same-class matches
- **Optimal Assignment**: Hungarian algorithm for global optimization
- **Threshold Filtering**: Minimum similarity threshold for valid matches
